# Sorting Algorithms

These are my sorting algorithms. I built these because I am learning c++. I made stagesort myself but im not sure if there is something similar out there.

## Installation

Click [bogosort](https://Simple-Script.github.io/sorting-algorithms/bogosort.py) to install bogosort or use the bash command below.

```bash
Invoke-WebRequest 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Simple-Script/sorting-algorithms/main/bogosort.py' -OutFile ./bogosort.py
```
Click [stagesort](https://Simple-Script.github.io/sorting-algorithms/stagesort.py) to install stagesort or use the bash command below.

## How to use

Run these scripts in a compiler online or application. The output should be shown.
